	<p>This project was conceived as a way to help Autodesk marketers unify their email campaigns and nurture programs. By using a lightweight email design system, messages being deployed from Marketo could stay consistent with Autodesk brand guidelines. In addition to this, there could be a quicker turnaround for campaigns because less time was spent coding new email templates from scratch.</p>
