		<p>I came to web development in a backward fashion: upon graduating from California College of the Arts with a BFA in Illustration, I knew I needed an online portfolio to show my work. Instead of hiring or working with a web developer, I decided to build a website on my own, thus beginning my love affair with code. Fueled by endless curiosity and a desire to learn, I taught myself the basics of front-end development: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

		<p>Since then I have gone on to learn jQuery, Sass, and PHP, as well as the fine and challenging art of HTML email development.</p>

		<p>I currently live in Oakland, California.</p>
