	<p>Mateo &amp; Isabel is a hand crafted paper goods company created by Elizabeth Lucas. My role has been maintaining and developing her website, as well as designing and assisting with her digital presence. Originally launched in 2009, the site itself has seen many iterations, going from a basic static site, to an overly complicated WordPress site, and now to the simplicity of GitHub Pages.</p>
