	<p>Mateo &amp; Isabel is a hand crafted, paper goods company created by Elizabeth Lucas. My role has been maintaining and developing her WordPress site, as well as designing and assisting with her digital presence on the web. Originally launched in 2009, the site itself has seen many iterations, going from a basic static site, to a WordPress blog, back to a static version, and finally back to WordPress, where I've made good use of Advanced Custom Fields to allow for easy content creation.</p>
